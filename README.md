# Insight to Suicides around the world

My final desertion project in DKIT while doing my final Semester of Msc. Sr. Jack was my lecture in this course supporting for programming.

The definition is “Suicide is an act of intentionally causing one’s own death”. It could be for different reasons. Conducting research in this area is quite challenging because I will have to look at different factors which cause people to make a decision to suicide. For example, someone may have psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder, depression, or even anxiety. Others might be killing themselves because of financial issues. So, the area of study is quite wide and it cannot be studied with few pieces of information. Though It’s hard, I strongly believe using data analytics skills and current analytic technologies, it’s possible to check and find a few things which could be a cause for death.
